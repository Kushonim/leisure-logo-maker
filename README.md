# leisure-logo-maker
## Description
The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file. This quick application was made to practice more with node and npm packages such as inquirer. As I worked on this I've come across important factors to ensure node works as intended and developed a better understanding of its purpose for back-end design.

## Installation & Demo
Simply download the files provided by the application's [repo](https://github.com/Kushonim/leisure-logo-maker) and/or follow along with the [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a0Ptasa9O9Pwt0JmXHBCyswtt5eXNcVh/view). If there is no video available, open the assets folder's integrated terminal and install all npm's and run the index.js file with node.

## Usage
The application once ran on node via the index.js file will prompt the user for the desired colors, shape, and test of the logo they're designing. Once all selections and preferences have been submitted, the application will generate the logo in a .svg file format and can be easily accesed through your default browser.
